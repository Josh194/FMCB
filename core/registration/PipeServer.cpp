		This should be shared with subsystem developers in an obvious place, along with a message encouraging them to write secure network code.
		Even still, the subsystem api should be written in such a way to reduce the risk of an experienced dev opening up their system for exploitation.

		Because of this, a subsystem-side api should be provided, and developers should be highly encouraged to use it, doing otherwise at their own (and any of their users) risk.

		Some/all network data should be encrypted, or an option should at least exist for it (maybe subsystems could opt-in to full or partial encryption depending on their content),
		as some users may prefer the slight performance boost in exchange for third parties being able to see the volume of dirt transferred between two games (of course network data may not always be so insignificant)
