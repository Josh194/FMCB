# How to contribute
If you would like to contribute to FMCB, thank you! We welcome any contributions, and will do our best to address issues and pull requests in a timely manner.
The steps outlined here should be followed as closely as possible to give you the best chance of getting your contribution accepted, but are not mandatory.
- **Work allocation**<br>
    Unless your contribution is truly tiny (Fixing a typo in a comment, cleaning up a function, a tiny bug fix, etc), you should use a github issue to tell us what you're working on.
    There are two ways of doing this:
    1. Comment on an issue stating your intentions to work on it, along with a link to your fork.
    2. Open a new issue and comment on it like above.
    
    As soon as a comment is made, you are free to begin working on the issue, we will notify you if there is any reason we do not want you to work on the issue in a follow up comment.

    In either situation, making a comment does not mean you are required to finish anything.
    We may assign you to an issue to indicate to others that it is already being worked on, but we do not expect you to make a pull request based on a comment.
    That being said, if you do decide to stop working on an issue, please make a second comment on the issue notifying us of that.
    
    Additionally, you are free to take up an issue that is already assigned to someone else, though note that doing so carries a risk of a rejected contribution.
    
    For the best chance of being assigned an issue, pick a low priority one, or one with the ```good first issue``` label.
    When assigned an issue, you can be fairly confident that no one else will do work overlapping with yours.
    <br>**Note to collaborators:** we should implement a backlog column for people to select issues from.
    
    Try not to pick very large issues, instead, pick a smaller chunk of one. This makes it more likely for us to be able to accept your work.

- **Forks**<br>
    Once you have found an issue you would like to work on, you should create a new branch in your fork, and begin work on it.
    Try to make frequent commits (1-2 a day) to make it easy for us to follow your work in a future pull request.
    
    Additionally, as soon as you feel somewhat confident you will be able to complete your issue,
    create a draft pull request to the ```develop``` branch with a short description of what your contribution does.

- **Pull requests**<br>
Once you feel you are ready, mark the pull request as ready for review, we will help you through the rest of the process for getting your work into FMCB!
